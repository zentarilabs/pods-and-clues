## 🔍 What is Pods & Clues?

**Pods & Clues** is an original educational storytelling project that teaches Kubernetes through episodic mysteries, character arcs, and immersive hands-on YAML challenges.

Set inside the futuristic Zentari Labs, the series follows three interns — Renzo, Zara, and Dev — as they navigate technical puzzles, uncover cloud secrets, and grow into real cloud engineers. With the help of their trusty support dog, Inspector Pupps, each case is a blend of learning and detective-style exploration.

Whether you're prepping for the CKAD exam or just curious about Kubernetes, this project makes the cloud fun, accessible, and unforgettable.
