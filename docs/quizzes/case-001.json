      "question": "Which environment handled sudden user traffic the fastest and most efficiently?",
      "options": {
        "A. Physical Server": "Dev: 'That thing got overwhelmed fast. No scaling, no chance.'",
        "B. Virtual Machine": "Zara: 'Better than the server, but still took time to spin up.'",
        "C. Containerized App": "Renzo: 'Correct. It autoscaled in seconds and kept user sessions smooth.'"

      "question": "What is one reason physical servers struggled under heavy load?",
      "options": {
        "A. They use too much memory": "Zara: 'Memory wasn’t the core issue. The bottleneck was how rigid the setup was.'",
        "B. They cannot scale quickly": "Renzo: 'Correct. Physical servers don’t scale without manual changes.'",
        "C. They have too many replicas": "Dev: 'Replicas? The server wished it had any.'"

      "options": {
        "A. Adding more apps to the same container": "Zara: 'No, containers are meant to stay focused. One app, one purpose.'",
        "B. Restarting the server when it fails": "Dev: 'That’s more like panic scaling, not autoscaling.'",
        "C. Automatically starting more container instances when needed": "Renzo: 'Correct. Containers scale horizontally to handle load spikes.'"

      "options": {
        "A. It crashed completely": "Dev: 'Nope, it stayed alive, just struggled to keep up.'",
        "B. It required a manual restart": "Zara: 'It did respond automatically, just not fast enough.'",
        "C. It took time to start a second VM instance": "Renzo: 'Correct. Spinning up a full VM takes longer than launching a new container.'"

      "options": {
        "A. Physical Servers": "Zara: 'Too slow, too static. Fine for legacy, not for cloud native.'",
        "B. Virtual Machines": "Dev: 'VMs try, but they’re not built for real time flexibility.'",
        "C. Containers": "Renzo: 'Correct. Containers are lightweight and designed to scale instantly with demand.'"
