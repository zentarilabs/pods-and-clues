# 🧩 What Is *Pods and Clues*?

*Pods and Clues* is not just a Kubernetes learning tool, it’s a story driven, mystery filled journey through the cloud.

* Part tech internship
* Part interactive comic
* Part terminal-based puzzle
* And totally unlike anything else

## 🚀 Learn Kubernetes by Solving a Mystery

You’ll follow three interns selected for a top secret cloud training program at Zentari Labs, a futuristic tech startup hiding something beneath the surface.

Through immersive cases, you’ll:

🧠 Learn real Kubernetes certification topics (CKAD, CKA, CKS)  
🕹️ Apply commands and YAML live as you progress  
📚 Connect emotionally to characters with relatable growth arcs  
🐾 Follow the clues with help from Inspector Pupps, the debugging goldendoodle with better instincts than most humans

## 🎭 The Setup

> Only the curious get chosen

[Renzo](characters/renzo.md). [Zara](characters/zara.md). [Dev](characters/dev.md). And [Inspector Pupps](characters/pupps.md), the sharp-eyed goldendoodle who never leaves Renzo’s side.
Three sharp-minded seniors (and one very good dog), chosen for a program no one talks about… but everyone wants in on.

They step into the elevator. Floor 22 glows. The doors open to polished silence, humming terminals, and a future that feels just a little too perfect.

Eight interns made it through. But one of them isn’t who they claim to be.

And in a world built on YAML, where namespaces define what’s visible and what isn’t…  
The real danger isn’t what you see.  
It’s what you miss.
