# 🧩 What Is *Pods and Clues*?

*Pods and Clues* is not just a Kubernetes learning tool, it’s a story driven, mystery filled journey through the cloud.

🔬 Part tech internship  
🖼️ Part interactive comic  
💻 Part terminal-based puzzle  
✨ And totally unlike anything else

## 🚀 Learn Kubernetes by Solving a Mystery

You’ll follow three interns selected for a top secret cloud training program at Zentari Labs, a futuristic tech startup hiding something beneath the surface.

Through immersive cases, you’ll:

🧠 Learn real Kubernetes certification topics (CKAD, CKA, CKS)  
🕹️ Apply commands and YAML live as you progress  
📚 Connect emotionally to characters with relatable growth arcs  
🐾 Follow the clues with help from Inspector Pupps, the debugging goldendoodle with better instincts than most humans

## 🎭 The Setup

> Only the curious get chosen

[Renzo](characters/renzo.md), [Zara](characters/zara.md), [Dev](characters/dev.md), and [Inspector Pupps](characters/pupps.md), the sharp-eyed goldendoodle who never leaves Renzo’s side. Three college seniors (and one very good dog), chosen for a program no one talks about… but everyone wants in on.

The doors slide open to polished silence, soft blue floor lights guiding the way, and an atmosphere that feels curated, like the future is expecting you.

Eight interns made it through. But one of them isn’t who they claim to be.

And in a world built on YAML, where namespaces define what’s visible and what isn’t…  
The real danger isn’t what you see.  
It’s what you miss.
