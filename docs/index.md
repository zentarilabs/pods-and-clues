# Welcome to Pods and Clues
*Only the curious get chosen.*

You're about to enter a different kind of cloud internship, one where YAML files hold secrets, and every `kubectl` command might uncover more than just pods.

At the heart of Zentari Labs, eight interns were selected from thousands of applicants to join **Project Nova**, a high-stakes program designed to shape the future of cloud infrastructure. But not everything is as it seems...

Follow Renzo, Zara, and Dev, three curious interns, as they step into a sleek, intimidating lobby for the first time. Among them is **Inspector Pupps**, Renzo’s emotionally intuitive golden doodle support dog who never leaves his side. Together, they're about to be tested in ways they never expected.
