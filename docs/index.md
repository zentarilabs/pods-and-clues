## 🎭 The Setup

> Only the curious get chosen

You’ll follow [Renzo](characters/renzo.md), [Zara](characters/zara.md), [Dev](characters/dev.md), and [Inspector Pupps](characters/pupps.md), the goldendoodle who never leaves Renzo’s side. These three interns have been choosen for a top secret cloud training program at Zentari Labs, a place built on innovation, and hiding something just out of sight.

The lobby is alive with movement, voices echoing through glass and steel. But in Renzo’s head, everything goes quiet.
It feels like stepping into a story already in motion. One he’s somehow supposed to finish.

Eight interns made it through.
But one of them is hiding something.

And in a place built to reveal your potential, what happens when someone learns how to hide?
