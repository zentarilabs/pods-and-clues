# Case 000: The Curious Ones

*Zentari Labs | Lobby | 8:45 AM*

The doors parted with a whisper of air and light.

Renzo stepped into Zentari Labs for the first time.

The lobby was massive, all curves and glass and soft-blue light pulsing beneath the floor tiles. Chrome beams arched overhead toward a skylight so wide it felt like it could open into space. Every detail was polished. Intentional. Like the building itself had been designed to intimidate.

Renzo slowed his steps, trying not to look overwhelmed.

At his side, Pupps trotted silently, tail swaying with a gentle rhythm. His golden curls bounced as he kept pace, scanning the space with calm, curious eyes.

Renzo clutched the strap of his backpack a little tighter.

*Okay. You're here. Just act like you belong.*  
*Even if you don’t feel it yet.*

Then the doors slid open again behind him.

He glanced over his shoulder.

A girl walked in with the kind of posture that didn’t ask for attention but got it anyway. Her curls were full and glossy, streaked with soft blonde highlights. She wore a tan blazer over a white top, light jeans, and spotless white sneakers. Everything about her was sharp, composed, and completely unfazed.

She scanned the room with a quiet efficiency, eyes moving fast. Then, for just a second, her gaze landed on Renzo.

He froze.
  
She didn’t smile. Didn’t nod. Just looked straight through him — like she was already sorting the room into categories and hadn’t decided which one he belonged in.

And then she walked past.

Renzo opened his mouth.  
Closed it.  
*Say something. Anything.*

Before the silence could stretch any longer—

“Yo!”

The voice snapped through the room like a ping from a live server.

A guy was approaching, fast. Hoodie slightly wrinkled, slacks loose, backpack slung over one shoulder like he’d been running to catch a train and was proud of it.

“Project Nova, right?” he said, holding out a fist mid-step.

Renzo hesitated — then bumped it.  
Soft. Unsure. But he did it.

“Nice,” the guy said, nodding. “First win of the day.”

Renzo let out a nervous breath.  
Zara — he didn’t know her name yet, but somehow it fit — didn’t look back.

Pupps sat down beside him, calm and watchful.  
Like he already knew: something was beginning.
