# TM-001: The Evolution of the App
---

**Welcome to Zentari Labs, Cohort 4.**

Before you deploy your first container, we need to ensure you understand the foundation. Kubernetes isnâ€™t just a buzzword, itâ€™s the orchestrator for the modern cloud, and to navigate it effectively, youâ€™ll need to know not just how it works, but how *we* use it here at Zentari.

This module will cover:

- How we got here: from physical servers to containers

## The Travel Analogy: From Ownership to Orchestration

> Letâ€™s say you need to get to different cities regularly.  
> Hereâ€™s how your transportation, and application hosting has evolved.

---

### **Stage 1: Owning a Car *(Physical Servers)***

You buy your own car.  
You're responsible for the cost, maintenance, fuel, repairs, and parking.  
Itâ€™s always available, but expensive and often underused.

**This is how we used to run applications:**  
One server per app. You owned, and managed it 24/7, even if it wasnâ€™t doing much.

---

### **Stage 2: Leasing a Car *(Virtual Machines)***

You stop owning and start **leasing** a car when you need it.  
You still drive it yourself, but the long term upkeep isnâ€™t your concern.  
Itâ€™s more flexible, and the same provider can lease multiple cars to different people.

**This is like virtual machines:**  
Shared physical resources, isolated environments.

---

### **Stage 3: Taking the Railway *(Containers + Kubernetes)***

Now you use the **railway system**.  
No ownership, no leases. You just show up, tap your card, and ride.  
The train is ready, and everything you need is built in.  
You donâ€™t worry about infrastructure, just where youâ€™re going.

**Thatâ€™s what containers bring:**  
Lightweight, portable environments that move easily across systems.

---

### **But trains alone arenâ€™t enoughâ€¦**

Imagine thousands of people moving between cities every hour.

- Who manages the schedules?
- Who reroutes trains when tracks fail?
- Who prevents overcrowding?

---

> **Thatâ€™s what Kubernetes does.**  
> Itâ€™s the **railway system** that is orchestrating thousands of apps (trains) across a system, automatically.

Let's revisit our railway analogy to understand the difference between **containers** and **pods**.

### ðŸš† Containers = Train Cars  
Containers are like individual **train cars**.  
Each one carries passengers (your app) and has everything it needs onboard such as seats, lights, AC, power.

But:

- A train car alone doesn't move
- It doesn't know where to go
- It needs to be assigned to a route and managed

---

### ðŸŽ« Pods = Scheduled Train Assignments  
A **pod** is like the **logical train assignment** that Kubernetes manages.  
It wraps the container in everything it needs to run in the system:

- A destination (which node)
- A ticket (IP address and identity)
- A platform assignment (scheduling info)
- Luggage (volume mounts)
- Instructions on how to travel with others (networking, probes)

---

Kubernetes never runs a container directly, it always wraps it in a **pod**.  
Even if it's a single container, the pod gives it context inside the cluster.

> _"Hereâ€™s your train car... but now itâ€™s on the schedule, with a route, a conductor, and a place to be."_

### âœ… Summary

![An image showing the difference between a container and a pod](../assets/tm-001/containers-pods.jpg)

Butâ€¦ as with any successful system, scale becomes the challenge. What happens when you need to manage **hundreds or thousands** of containers?

That we will discuss in the next Training Module.
