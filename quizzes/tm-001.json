        "It’s hard to plug in": "That’s not the problem, setup isn’t the issue. Scaling is.",
        "It only works on Wi-Fi": "Nope! Physical servers can be wired or wireless. That’s not the issue.",
        "It’s expensive and doesn’t adjust when traffic increases": "Correct! Physical servers are powerful but rigid. They can’t flex when traffic spikes.",
        "You can’t install software on it": "You can definitely install software. That’s what they’re made for."

        "They’re free to use": "Not quite. Cloud VMs usually cost money too.",
        "You can run more than one app on the same machine": "Correct! VMs let you share hardware by running multiple isolated systems.",
        "They turn into containers automatically": "Nope. VMs and containers are different technologies.",
        "They never crash": "That would be nice… but not true."

      "question": "What makes containers so useful for modern apps?",
      "options": {
        "They come with free internet": "Fun idea, but nope. Network config isn’t automatic magic.",
        "They fix bugs on their own": "Wouldn’t that be nice? You still need developers for that.",
        "They start quickly and can grow or shrink depending on traffic": "Correct! Containers are lightweight and work great with autoscaling.",
        "They use more electricity": "Actually, they tend to be more efficient than traditional setups."

      "question": "Why have we moved from servers to VMs to containers?",
      "options": {
        "Because newer tools look cooler": "Looks don’t matter, scalability and resilience do.",
        "Because apps are smaller now": "Apps may be smaller, but that’s not the reason for the shift.",
        "Because we need systems that can grow, recover, and keep running without manual work": "Correct! The evolution is all about building systems that adapt and survive at scale.",
        "Because VMs stopped working": "VMs still work. Containers just offer more flexibility."

      "options": {
        "Owning a sports car": "That’s more like a physical server, powerful, but limited to one use.",
        "Riding a train that adds cars when more people show up": "Correct! Containers are like train cars that are modular, scalable, and efficient.",
        "Driving a rental truck": "Closer to a VM, flexible but heavier than a container.",
        "Biking uphill": "That sounds painful, not scalable!"
