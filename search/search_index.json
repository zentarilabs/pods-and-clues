Beside him, Inspector Pupps sat alert but calm, golden curls glowing in the morning light like they belonged here.</p> <p>Renzo wasn\u2019t so sure he did.</p> <p>The space buzzed with movement and quiet confidence, like everyone else had already passed some unspoken test.</p> <p>\"What if I\u2019m not ready? What if they realize I don\u2019t belong?\"</p> <p></p> <p>Renzo adjusted the strap on his bookbag, nerves prickling just beneath his skin. He glanced down at Pupps, who gave a soft, grounding huff, a reminder that he wasn\u2019t alone.</p> <p>A sharp tap of sneakers on polished tile snapped his attention to the entrance behind him.</p> <p>Zara had arrived.</p> <p>Her curls bounced with each stride, blonde highlights catching the light. She moved with quiet precision. She had a rust blazer, jeans, white sneakers, gold earrings, and a tote slung confidently over one shoulder.</p> <p></p> <p>She met Renzo\u2019s eyes and offered a small, composed smile. Not overly warm. But real. Like she saw him.</p> <p>Renzo blinked, caught off guard. She looks like she belongs here too.</p> <p>\"Say something\", he thought. \"Anything. You\u2019re both interns. She probably feels weird too.\" But the words stuck somewhere between his nerves and his throat.</p> <p>Before the silence settled too heavily, the lobby doors opened again.</p> <p>Dev stepped in, hoodie layered over a t-shirt, jeans, and a bag packed like he was staying the night. His eyes lit up at the sight of the others.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cYo! You Nova too?\u201d Dev grinned, his energy already filling the space as he offered a fist bump.</p> <p>Renzo met it a beat late, but it landed.</p> <p>Dev had the kind of presence that made the lobby feel just a little less intimidating.</p> <p>Zara offered a small, friendly smile, then glanced at the welcome email on her phone. \u201cFloor 22,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re headed.\u201d</p> <p>After checking in, they headed towards the main elevators. Renzo kept pace beside her, fingers brushing the strap of his backpack. The silence wasn\u2019t unfriendly, just expectant. Like the building was holding its breath. Or maybe\u2026 he was.</p>"},{"location":"cases/case-000/#elevator-to-floor-22-first-impressions","title":"Elevator to Floor 22, First Impressions","text":"<p>Zara stepped in first and tapped the number 22. The touchscreen lit up, a glowing blue ring swirling around it as the trio entered and the doors slid shut.</p> <p>Renzo stood silently, his bag still strapped tightly to his shoulders. Dev swayed slightly, bobbing to a beat in his head. Zara was already scrolling on her phone.</p> <p>He could feel the difference between them. Dev seemed like the type who made friends in five minutes. Zara looked like she didn\u2019t need anyone at all. Pupps sat between them, calm as ever. His tail brushed Renzo\u2019s ankle in a quiet reassurance.</p> <p>Dev leaned forward, eyes scanning the glowing panel. \"Crazy, right? Out of everyone\u2026 why us?\" Renzo nodded, but Zara didn\u2019t even look up.</p> <p>The elevator chimed.

A single line of text glowed near the floor:</p> <p>Only the curious get chosen.</p> <p></p> <p>Dev stepped out first, grinning. \"I like the vibes already.\"</p> <p>The room was a spacious training floor with individual desks, each with a Zentari laptop. Renzo counted eight in total.\u00a0</p> <p>\"Are there more of us?\" he asked quietly.</p> <p>Zara didn\u2019t turn. \"Eight total. We\u2019re just early.\"</p> <p>Renzo slid into the seat farthest from the door. Pupps curled up beside his chair without a sound. Zara took the spot two seats down. Dev sat between them. </p> <p>Four other interns stepped into the room. Some walked directly to their laptops. Others hovered, scanning the space like they weren\u2019t sure where to sit. No one said much. Then came the last: a tall girl with silver glasses with a low side braid. She gave a polite nod to no one in particular and made her way to a desk at the other far end.</p> <p></p> <p>As the final intern stepped into the room, the lights dimmed. A soft chime echoed overhead. Then, with quiet confidence, a sharply dressed man entered behind them. He moved to the center of the room, raised a hand, and the space responded. A glowing \u201cZ\u201d emblem shimmered into view, slowly rotating before unfolding into a full holographic display.</p> <p></p> <p>\"Welcome to Zentari Labs\" he said, voice calm and reassuring. \"My name is Hiro and I will be one of the leading mentors in this cohort. You weren\u2019t just chosen for your skills, you were chosen because you\u2019re curious. And in this place, only the curious move forward. You are Cohort 4 of Project Nova. Thousands applied. Only eight were selected\"</p> <p>Dev whispered, \"Only the curious get chosen, interesting.\"</p> <p>\"Project Nova is a fully immersive experience. You\u2019ll receive new cases, and each one reflects a real world challenge you might face in a cloud native environment. But before each case begins, you\u2019ll complete a brief training module. These are delivered directly to your terminal. Complete the module, and then unlock the case.\"</p> <p>Zara leaned back slightly, arms crossed.</p> <p>\"Your first tasks begins with how apps have evolved and the need for Kubernetes. You\u2019ll be introduced to the CLI short for command line interface and kubectl, short for Kubernetes Control. There has been debate on how to pronounce it. But if you want to stand out and be right it\u2019s kyoob-see-tee-ell.\"</p> <p>Renzo nodded slightly to himself.</p> <p>\"Training modules will teach you what you need to know while the cases will show you if you\u2019ve truly learned it.\"</p> <p>The hologram folded down like origami into a single blinking prompt.</p> <p>\"Good luck, Cohort 4. Your journey starts now\" he added, already walking toward the exit. He didn\u2019t look back, he didn\u2019t need to. The door slid closed behind him with a soft hiss. The room returned to normal light.</p> <p>Renzo stared at the screen. Next to him, Dev was already typing. Zara was skimming the training module. Pupps had curled up under the desk again, a small safe zone.</p> <p>Renzo exhaled. He tapped the trackpad. The screen blinked to life.</p> <p>Welcome to Zentari Labs</p> <p>Press ENTER to begin the training module...</p> <p>He nervously pressed ENTER.</p> <p></p> <p>Pupps sat close, his quiet presence grounding.
